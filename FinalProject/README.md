 This small music interaction piece is to describe a scene in the animation, [the night is short, Walk on girl](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_night_is_short_walk_on_girl), by Masaaki Yuasa.

In the story, the protagonist is always running forwards🏃‍♀️ and the world would change🔊 as she moving on. and in one of the scene, two boxes filled with apples🍎 crashed on the high floor, then the apples fall down like the rain☔️. I wanted to presented this elements in my output...

## Using 'W' to march(change the velocity and also the speed of music), 'A' to left side, 'D' to right side. 'Q' for move upward, 'Z' for move downward.
## ' ', Space for create apples.
